## Overview

Welcome to the Airline Analysis project! This README file provides an overview of the key objectives, findings, and insights derived from our analysis of airline performance data over a period of 5 years. Our primary focus was to investigate the relationship between on-time flights, delays, and the causes of delays. Through this analysis, we aim to answer important questions regarding airline performance and help stakeholders make informed decisions.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this analysis were to:

1.  Determine which airlines have the highest on-time performance and assess the correlation between the month of the year and airline performance.
2.  Identify the main causes for delays, specifically focusing on the leading cause known as NAS (National Airspace System) delays.
3.  Examine how travel delays are affected by the month of the year.
4.  Explore whether certain travel routes are more prone to delays than others.

## Key Findings and Insights

### 1. On-Time Performance by Airlines

We examined the on-time performance of various airlines over the 5-year period. It was observed that the correlation between the month of the year and on-time performance was weak, with an r-value consistently below 0.3. Notably, in 2019, on-time performance was higher, likely due to a reduced number of flights throughout the year. However, there was a noticeable decline in on-time performance in 2022, possibly due to limited data availability for that year's second half.

### 2. Causes of Delays

The analysis revealed that NAS delays were the leading cause of flight delays across all airlines. NAS delays are those that could be minimized through corrective measures taken by airports or the Federal Aviation Administration. Given ongoing advancements in technology aimed at weather-avoidance capabilities, it is reasonable to anticipate improvements in reducing delayed flights.

### 3. Monthly Variation in Delays

By examining data from different airlines for individual arrival and departure delays, we made the following observations:

-   Delays were inconsistent in the first and fourth quarters (Q1 and Q4).
-   The number of delays increased in the second quarter (Q2) and gradually decreased in the third quarter (Q3).
-   Most graphs displayed a positive relationship between the month and delays, suggesting that the number of delays tends to increase towards the end of the year.

### 4. Routes Prone to Delays

Upon analyzing the data, it was evident that the travel route from Raleigh-Durham International to Newark Liberty International experienced the highest average delay. Additionally, there was a notable increase in delays across all airlines and selected routes during the month of August.

## Data Visualizations

Throughout this analysis, we have utilized various data visualizations, including scatter plots and regression lines, to illustrate patterns and correlations uncovered in the data. These visual representations are essential for effectively communicating our findings and facilitating a comprehensive understanding of airline on-time performance.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into airline performance over a 5-year period, shedding light on the factors influencing on-time performance, causes of delays, and their monthly variations. It also highlights specific routes that are more prone to delays. These findings can assist airlines, airports, and regulators in making data-driven decisions to enhance the efficiency and reliability of air travel.
